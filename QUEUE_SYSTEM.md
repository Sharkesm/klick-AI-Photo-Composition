# Image Analysis Queue System

## Overview

The Klick app now includes a sophisticated queuing system for image analysis that allows users to process multiple images while maintaining control over ongoing operations.

## Key Features

### 1. **Queue Management**
- **FIFO (First In, First Out)**: Images are processed in the order they were added
- **Priority Support**: Tasks can be assigned different priority levels
- **State Management**: Queue can be idle, processing, paused, or stopped

### 2. **Cancellation Support**
- **Stop Current Analysis**: Users can stop the currently processing image
- **Clear Queue**: Remove all pending tasks
- **Pause/Resume**: Temporarily pause processing without losing queue

### 3. **User Experience**
- **Smart Prompts**: When adding a new image during analysis, users get options:
  - Add to Queue: Continue current analysis and queue the new image
  - Replace Current: Stop current analysis and start with new image
  - Cancel: Do nothing

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### `ImageAnalysisQueue`
```swift
class ImageAnalysisQueue: ObservableObject {
    @Published var queueState: QueueState = .idle
    @Published var currentTask: AnalysisTask?
    @Published var pendingTasks: [AnalysisTask] = []
    @Published var completedTasks: [AnalysisTask] = []
    @Published var failedTasks: [AnalysisTask] = []
}
```

#### `AnalysisTask`
```swift
struct AnalysisTask: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let image: UIImage
    let priority: TaskPriority
    let createdAt: Date
}
```

### Queue States

- **`.idle`**: No tasks in queue, ready for new images
- **`.processing`**: Currently analyzing an image
- **`.paused`**: Queue paused, current task continues
- **`.stopped`**: Analysis stopped, queue cleared

### Cancellation Mechanism

The system uses multiple layers of cancellation:

1. **Task Level**: Each analysis task can be cancelled independently
2. **Queue Level**: Stop all operations and clear queue
3. **Analyzer Level**: Cancel the underlying Vision framework operations

```swift
func cancelAnalysis() {
    isCancelled = true
    currentAnalysisTask?.cancel()
    currentAnalysisTask = nil
    analysisState = .idle
    progress = AnalysisProgress(percent: 0, message: "")
}
```

## User Interface

### Queue Management View
- **Status Display**: Shows current queue state and progress
- **Queue Information**: Pending, completed, and failed task counts
- **Action Buttons**: Stop, pause, resume, clear history
- **Estimated Time**: Shows remaining processing time

### Smart Alerts
When a user tries to add a new image during analysis:

```
"An analysis is currently in progress. Would you like to:
- Add to Queue: Continue current analysis and queue the new image
- Replace Current: Stop current analysis and start with new image
- Cancel: Do nothing"
```

## Usage Examples

### Adding Images to Queue
```swift
// Simple enqueue
queue.enqueueImage(image)

// With priority
queue.enqueueImage(image, priority: .high)
```

### Managing Queue
```swift
// Stop current analysis and clear queue
queue.stopAnalysis()

// Pause queue (current task continues)
queue.pauseQueue()

// Resume paused queue
queue.resumeQueue()

// Clear history
queue.clearHistory()
```

### Monitoring Queue
```swift
// Check if processing
if queue.isProcessing {
    // Show progress
}

// Check queue size
let pendingCount = queue.queueSize

// Get estimated time
let timeRemaining = queue.estimatedTimeRemaining
```

## Benefits

### 1. **User Control**
- Users can manage multiple images without losing work
- Clear options when conflicts arise
- Visual feedback on queue status

### 2. **Performance**
- Non-blocking UI during analysis
- Efficient resource management
- Graceful cancellation

### 3. **Reliability**
- Robust error handling
- State consistency
- Progress tracking

### 4. **Scalability**
- Easy to add new queue features
- Extensible priority system
- Modular design

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Priority Queue**: Process high-priority images first
2. **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple images simultaneously
3. **Background Processing**: Continue analysis when app is backgrounded
4. **Queue Persistence**: Save queue state across app launches
5. **Advanced Scheduling**: Time-based processing

### Technical Enhancements
1. **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of completed tasks
2. **Progress Callbacks**: More granular progress updates
3. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for failed analyses
4. **Analytics**: Track queue performance metrics

## Integration Points

The queue system integrates with existing components:

- **ContentView**: Main UI with queue management
- **PhotoCaptureView**: Smart image selection
- **CompositionAnalyzer**: Enhanced with cancellation
- **QueueManagementView**: Dedicated queue UI

This system provides a robust foundation for handling multiple image analyses while maintaining excellent user experience and system performance.
