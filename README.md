# Klick - Smart Photo Composition App

A real-time camera assistant that teaches photographers composition techniques through live feedback and intelligent subject detection.

## üéØ What It Does

Klick provides instant composition guidance while you frame photos, helping you learn photography techniques through practice rather than theory.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### üìπ **Camera System**
- **Live Camera Feed**: Real-time preview with minimal latency
- **Tap-to-Focus**: Touch anywhere to focus and adjust exposure
- **Flash Control**: Auto, on, or off flash modes
- **Background Processing**: Smooth performance without UI lag

### üì∏ **Photo Management**
- **Photo Capture**: High-quality JPEG/HEVC photo capture
- **Local Storage**: Photos saved to app's document directory
- **Photo Library Integration**: Automatic saving to device photo library
- **Gallery View**: Grid-based photo browser with smooth animations
- **Photo Viewing**: Full-screen photo display with capture details
- **Delete Options**: Individual or batch photo deletion

### üß† **Smart Detection**
- **Face Detection**: Prioritizes human faces for composition analysis
- **Human Detection**: Falls back to full-body detection when no faces found
- **Real-Time Processing**: Analyzes every 3rd frame for optimal performance

### üé® **Composition Analysis**
- **Rule of Thirds**: 3√ó3 grid with intersection point guidance
- **Center Framing**: Crosshair overlay with symmetry analysis
- **Symmetry Detection**: Pixel-level vertical symmetry evaluation
- **Live Feedback**: Instant directional guidance ("Move left", "Perfect!")

### üéì **Learning Features**
- **Educational Content**: Built-in explanations of composition techniques
- **Interactive Learning**: Learn by doing with real-time feedback
- **Progressive Guidance**: Adaptive tolerance for easier learning

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Customization**
- **Composition Types**: Switch between Rule of Thirds, Center Framing, and Symmetry
- **Toggle Controls**: Enable/disable face detection, overlays, and analysis
- **Visual Settings**: Customize overlay visibility and analysis behavior

## üõ† Technical Stack

- **SwiftUI + UIKit**: Modern UI with reliable camera integration
- **AVFoundation**: Camera capture and video processing
- **Vision Framework**: Face and human detection
- **Core Image**: Image processing and analysis
- **iOS 16.0+**: Modern iOS features and APIs

## üì± Requirements

- **Device**: iPhone 12 or newer
- **iOS**: 16.0 or later
