## 🚦 Decision Process

### Step 1: Initial Assessment

**Before ANY implementation**, answer:

1. **What problem does this solve?**
   - Must be specific and related to composition learning

2. **Who is this for?**
   - Must be for beginner/intermediate photographers

3. **How does it teach composition?**
   - If answer is unclear → STOP

4. **What's the alternative?**
   - Is there a roadmap feature that's better?

### Step 2: Framework Evaluation

Complete the evaluation framework:
- Score each criterion honestly
- Calculate weighted total
- **< 70 points**: REJECT immediately
- **70-84 points**: Needs justification
- **85+ points**: Strong candidate

### Step 3: Architecture Review

**Check technical alignment**:
- ✅ Extends existing protocols (CompositionService, etc.)
- ✅ Follows MVVM + Service Layer pattern
- ✅ Reuses current Vision/AVFoundation pipeline
- ✅ Maintains performance characteristics

**Red flags**:
- ❌ Requires new major dependencies
- ❌ Breaks existing patterns
- ❌ Impacts real-time performance
- ❌ Adds significant complexity

### Step 4: Documentation Check

**Before implementation**:
1. Read relevant docs in `Documentation/`
2. Check if similar feature exists
3. Review `FEATURE_CATALOG.md` for roadmap
4. Verify architectural fit in `ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`

### Step 5: Decision & Documentation

**If approved**:
- Document decision rationale
- Update `FEATURE_CATALOG.md`
- Plan documentation updates
- Follow implementation patterns

**If rejected**:
- Document why it doesn't fit
- Suggest alternatives if applicable
- Consider for spin-off project

## 🎓 Real Examples

### ✅ APPROVED: Symmetry Composition Service

**Proposal**: Add symmetry analysis for composition feedback

**Evaluation**:
```
Vision Alignment: 35/35 - Core composition technique ✅
User Value: 28/30 - Symmetry is fundamental concept ✅
Technical Fit: 15/15 - Perfect CompositionService fit ✅
ROI: 9/10 - 3-4 days, high value ✅
Brand Clarity: 10/10 - Strengthens core mission ✅
TOTAL: 97/100 → APPROVED ✅
```

**Implementation**: `CompositionService.swift` - SymmetryService class

### ❌ REJECTED: Social Media Sharing

**Proposal**: Add ability to share photos to Instagram/Facebook

**Evaluation**:
```
Vision Alignment: 5/35 - Doesn't teach composition ❌
User Value: 15/30 - Users can already do this ❌
Technical Fit: 10/15 - Needs new SDKs ❌
ROI: 3/10 - High effort, low unique value ❌
Brand Clarity: 2/10 - Makes us look like social app ❌
TOTAL: 35/100 → REJECTED ❌
```

**Reasoning**: Dilutes focus, users can share via Photos app

### ❌ REJECTED: Hotdog Detection

**Proposal**: Identify hotdogs in food photos

**Evaluation**:
```
Vision Alignment: 1/35 - Zero composition teaching ❌
User Value: 1/30 - Not photographer need ❌
Technical Fit: 3/15 - Requires ML classification ❌
ROI: 2/10 - 10+ days for no user value ❌
Brand Clarity: 1/10 - Completely off-brand ❌
TOTAL: 8/100 → REJECTED ❌
```

**Reasoning**: Wrong product, wrong users, wrong mission

### ⚠️ CONDITIONAL: Food Photography Mode

**Proposal**: Specialized composition rules for food photography

**Evaluation**:
```
Vision Alignment: 25/35 - Teaches food composition ⚠️
User Value: 20/30 - Niche but valuable subset ⚠️
Technical Fit: 14/15 - Uses existing patterns ✅
ROI: 6/10 - Major feature, specialized audience ⚠️
Brand Clarity: 7/10 - Expands scope significantly ⚠️
TOTAL: 72/100 → CONDITIONAL ⚠️
```

**Decision**: Not for v1.0. Consider for v2.0 with:
- Full set of food composition rules (overhead, 45°, etc.)
- Educational content specific to food photography
- Enough market validation for niche

---

## 🛡️ Guardrails & Constraints

### Immutable Constraints

**NEVER compromise on**:
1. **Core Mission**: Must teach composition
2. **Target User**: Beginner/intermediate photographers
3. **Real-time Performance**: 10 FPS minimum, 30 FPS preview
4. **Architecture Patterns**: MVVM + Service Layer
5. **Code Quality**: Performance, memory, threading rules

### Warning Signs (Feature Creep Indicators)

**Stop immediately if**:
- ❌ "While we're at it, let's also add..."
- ❌ "This is similar to [unrelated app]..."
- ❌ "It would be cool if..."
- ❌ "Everyone has this feature..."
- ❌ "Just a small addition..."

**Ask instead**:
- ✅ "Does this teach composition?"
- ✅ "Will photographers learn from this?"
- ✅ "Is this on our roadmap?"
- ✅ "Does this strengthen our mission?"

### Scope Expansion Rules

**To expand scope beyond composition learning**:

1. **Requires**: Product vision update in `PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md`
2. **Requires**: Explicit approval with documented reasoning
3. **Requires**: Re-evaluation of ALL out-of-scope examples
4. **Requires**: Brand impact assessment

**Default**: When in doubt, say NO. Focused products win.

## 🔑 Key Principles

### Focus is a Competitive Advantage

- **Good products**: Do one thing exceptionally well
- **Bad products**: Do many things adequately
- **Klick's thing**: Teach composition through real-time feedback

### When to Say No

**Say NO to**:
- Features that don't teach composition
- Features users can get elsewhere
- Features that dilute brand identity
- Features not on roadmap without strong justification

**Say YES to**:
- Composition techniques (core mission)
- Learning experience improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Better feedback mechanisms

### The "Hotdog Test"

**Question**: "Does this feature pass the hotdog test?"

**If someone asks**: "Why does a composition camera app detect hotdogs?"
**And you can't give a compelling composition-teaching answer**
**Then**: Feature fails, reject immediately

---

**Remember**: Every feature has a cost. Every addition is a commitment. Every "yes" is a hundred "no's". Stay focused on teaching composition.

**Default Answer**: NO

**Right Answer**: "Does it teach composition?"
